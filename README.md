# Python CSGOStash Skin Scraper

Grabs names, prices and collections of CSGO skins from CSGOStash.com. Saves as a .json file.

Required versions of BeautifulSoup4 and requests modules available in dependencies.txt


This is just a quick project I put together for a friend, if you've stumbled across this page you're likely better off using [https://github.com/supr3meofficial/csgostash-scraper](this project). Much nicer codebase but it doesn't grab the prices.
